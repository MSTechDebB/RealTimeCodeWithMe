## Introduction
This project provides step-by-step examples of implementing SOLID principles in C# and applying these principles to real-time use cases.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository and set up your development environment.

## SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Ensure each class has one responsibility.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Make classes extendable without modifying them.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Use specific interfaces rather than a general-purpose interface.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions.

## Real-Time Use Cases
- Stock Trading Systems
- Real-Time Chat Applications
- Online Multiplayer Gaming
